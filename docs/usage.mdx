# How to use my project
Talon aims to find the sweet spot between two opposing sides:

1. Ease of use
Time to setup, required knowledge

2. Customizability
Works in all situations, works with all projects

This is why Talon abstracts away the complexities of syncing and composing the
different functionalities, while the user still needs to set up the specific
implementations, such that Talon can be used with every backend.

A very common solution would be to use `sqflite` as the local database and
`supabase` as the server database. There is a full example of how to build an app
with these solutions, with an in-depth explanation in these docs
