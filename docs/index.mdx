# Motivation

The motivation behind this package is to provide a super leightweight,
dependency free layer that enables powerful offline first databases.  The user
should be able to use their offline & online database of choice, and only needs
to provide a couple of basic functions to this package that will enable all the
syncing.

Once the basic setup is done (~300 lines of code), the whole data storage part
of your app is done. This enables you to save data in the following way:

```dart
class TodoRepository {
  final table = 'todos';
  final nameField = 'name';
  final isDoneField = 'is_done';

  Future<void> addTodo(String id, String name) async {
    await talon.saveChange(
      table: table,
      row: id,
      column: nameField,
      value: name,
    );
  }

  Future<void> updateIsDone(String id, bool todoState) async {
    await talon.saveChange(
      table: table,
      row: id,
      column: isDoneField,
      value: todoState ? '1' : '0',
    );
  }
}
```

Whenever a user makes any change to the data inside the app, all you need to do
is call `talon.saveChange()` and everything is handled. This function will:
- Save the change to the local database
- Upload the save on the next chance to the server
- Handle conflicts if a user changes the same data from two different devices

Once this is setup, you have the full power of offline first databases, where
all data is available in a SQL table on the phone, allowing for any queries
of user data, no matter the users connectivity, while also solving all conflicts
with eventual consistency between different devices.


## End Product

Once implemented, the app will work offline without internet connection
indefinetly and without any latency (besides the local database latency).  If an
internet connection comes back online, the app will sync to the server, sending
its local changes to the server, and reading missed changes from the server.
Multiple clients (your app) can use the same account at the same time. This
implementation takes care of deciding which data is correct, such that all
devices end up with the same state after syncing. (Eventual consistency)

## How it works

Additionally to all the tables you set up in your app, this syncing layer needs
one additional table: `messages`.  In this table, each `message` will be stored.
A message is a change to a field in your database. When the user changes for
example a todo in your app, the syncing layer would create a message with the
following arguments:

```dart
final message = Message(
    table: 'todos',
    row: 'id_of_changed_todo',
    column: 'name',
    value: 'Some new todo name',

    /// automatically set parameters:
    hasBeenSynced: false,
    localTimestamp: now(),
    clientId: getClientId(),
    userId: getUserId(),
);
```

This message would then be added to the local `messages` table, as well as
applied to the local `todos` table, changing the specified field.  On the next
sync with your server, this message would be sent to the server, and if received
successfully, `hasBeenSynced` would be set to true in your local `messages`
table, indicating that it has been seen by the server and doesn't need to be
synced again.

During syncing we not only upload all our local messages that haven't been seen
by the server, we also fetch all of the messages that we have not seen from the
server.

The `messages` table on the server has two fields that help us sync only the
messages that we haven't seen before: `clientId` & `id`.

`clientId` refers to the device that generated this message, in the case of apps
usually a phone id. When we query for unseen messages, we only want messages
with the `clientId` not equal to our own, since we already know the messages we
sent ourself.

`id` is an increasing integer, starting from 0, that is increasing and unique
per user (ie. a composite key). It keeps track of the order in which the
messages have been received by the server. This means that if a client has
synced all messages until id 5000, it can store this id locally and the next
time only has to read messages with id bigger than 5000.

The combination of `clientId` and `id` ensures that when a client syncs, it only
ever downloads relevant messages from the server that have not yet been seen by
the client, ensuring minimal data transfer.

Note: `id` refers to the order in which the server has received the messages. It
does not have anything to do with when the changes were actually made and which
changes will 'win' the write for a field in the database. A change could happen,
then the user uses the app offline for a month, and only then syncs the changes.
